Core classes
============

Computations and transformations are based on two classes, which provide the user-side interface of computation objects.

.. autoclass:: tigger.core.Computation
    :members:

.. autoclass:: tigger.core.Transformation
    :members:

.. autoclass:: tigger.core.operation.OperationRecorder
    :members:

.. autoclass:: tigger.core.ArrayValue

.. autoclass:: tigger.core.ScalarValue
